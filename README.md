# PoetAI
Generation of Poem by training and fine tuning GPT2
For the longest time, machine learning models have been deployed to perform
analytical tasks and identify patterns in data that are otherwise difficult to discern
by the human eye. These tasks are highly objective in nature and have a fixed
“true” value that we want the machine to be able to predict. However, what if we
could use ‘art’-ificial intelligence to create art? The expected output here wouldn’t
be a numerical value or a class, but rather an art piece that is creative, expressive,
and appealing to humans. For our project, we focus on using machine learning to
generate poetry. Specifically, PoetAI generates limericks (5-line contextual poems
with AABBA rhyme scheme) of high quality where quality is assessed using 2
metrics - rhyming and context. We are proposing a pipeline driven by transformer-
based models that generates limericks and then scores and filters the good quality
limericks score based on various aspects including rhyme and context. A final
language model tries to fix the rhyming to enhance limerick quality. PoetAI holds
numerous business applications, especially in the field of customized marketing
and messaging
